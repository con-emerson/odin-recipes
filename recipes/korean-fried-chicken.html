      <h2>Korean Fried Chicken</h2>
      <p>
        This Korean fried chicken recipe is officially my favorite. I've had
        every style of fried chicken known to man, so I've always considered
        myself an expert. No other method I've come across has the same
        combination of tender, juicy, flavorful chicken and plate-scratching
        crispiness as this recipe does. It's simply a must-try!

        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>&frac12 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Other:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Batter:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>&frac34 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>&frac12 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>&frac12 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>&frac14 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper
          in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic
          wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171
          degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          While oil is heating, make batter: Whisk together cornstarch, flour,
          sugar, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water
          until mixture resembles smooth pancake batter. Use tongs to remove
          chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely.
          Discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer
          chicken to a cooling rack.
        </li>
        <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown
          and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
